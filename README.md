# Linear-Regression
We implement the learning algorithm linear regression from scratch with python. The only library that is necessary is numpy ad the details about the algorithm and the implementation can be found in the notebook.

The algorithm is implemented as a python class with functions as its methods, similarly to how it is done in scikit-learn. The first step is always to initialize the model in the following way:

-> model = lin_reg(...)
